    "In understanding what the numpy.random package, I'm initially going to outline what the NumPy Python package is used for. The current (NumPy manual)[https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/user/whatisnumpy.html] describes as \"the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python\".\n",

    "The numpy.random package, being a collecion of functions that generate *pseudorandom* numbers and data. Due to the present limitations of computer hardware, it is impossible to generate a *true* random number. But this isn't really a problem for us, unless we are trying to generate *cryptographically secure* random numbers.\n",
